How to run
========================

1. Copy wis-br-cancer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar to a location
2. Copy the resources folder from the source location to the location you copy the jar
3. Resources file contains data files and properties file (kmeans.properties) where you can change different properties (eg: number.of.centroids,threshold, iterations, vfold.cross.validation.blocks)
4. To run the jar, in the command line type :
        java -Xmx1024m -jar wis-br-cancer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar {parameters}

        For ppv, powPPV and vfold options you can say how to use cleaned data set. There are two options to clean the data set.
            1. Clean the data set by replacing the mean of the missing attribute (rp)
            2. Clean the data set by removing the data entries with missing data (rm)

        You can provide different parameters.
            -c = to get correlations between the attributes
                 eg :   java -Xmx1024m -jar wis-br-cancer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -c
            -ppv = to calculate the PPV value considering all the attributes with rm or rp options
                 eg :   java -Xmx1024m -jar wis-br-cancer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -ppv rm
            -powPPV = to calculate the PPV value for the power set of attributes with changing K values with rm or rp options. K value is changing from 2 to 20 with increment of 2
                 eg :   java -Xmx1024m -jar wis-br-cancer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -powPPV rp
            -vfold = to calculate the V fold cross validation with rm or rp options.
                 eg :   java -Xmx1024m -jar wis-br-cancer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -vfold rm

How to build
===================================

1. Go to wis-br-cancer location in the command line. In there you will find a pom.xml
2. To build, run the command
        mvn clean install
    In the target folder it will create the executable jar with all the dependencies as wis-br-cancer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar

3. To create source artifacts for Eclipse and Intellij-Idea, run the command
        eclipse - mvn eclipse:eclipse
        idea - mvn idea:idea
    Now you will be able to open the wis-br-cancer in your IDE.
